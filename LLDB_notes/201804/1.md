(lldb)

This will dump out all the dynamically loaded modules Xcode has loaded into the process that contain or link to Swift code.


## This is using Python along with LLDB’s Python module (confusingly also called "lldb"). You’ll get very accustomed to working with this module in section IV of this book as you learn to build custom, advanced LLDB scripts.


From this list of dynamic Swift libraries, one is a particular module of interest: IDEPegasusSourceEditor. This is a dynamic library (just like UIKit or Foundation) that contains some interesting Swift classes pertaining to the code editing views in Xcode.

> Note: Apple frequently uses code names for internal development features. For example, an iPad’s picture-on-picture feature is commonly referred to as “Medusa” in internal methods — and no, not all Apple code names are Greek code names. So, what’s up with this Pegasus name? There’s often specific reasoning to the Apple development team (or manager/s?) assigning these names. Your guess is as good as mine, but I can see a logical connection between a mythological creature that symbolizes wisdom and the visual display to your source code.
