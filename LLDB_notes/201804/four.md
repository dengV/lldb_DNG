## A "Swiftly" changing landscape



> Apple has been cautious in its adoption of Swift in its own software — and understandably so. No matter one’s (seemingly religious) beliefs on Swift, for better or worse, it’s still an immature language moving at an incredible pace with breaking changes. I still have flashbacks of the “great” Swift 2.2 -> 3.0 migration and I am sure many of you do too.
