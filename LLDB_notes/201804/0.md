These large codebase migrations do not sit well in enterprise environments where frameworks with different dependencies have to play nicely with each other. If one framework containing Swift code has breaking changes, it can bring down a whole codebase. Then imagine if hundreds of frameworks contained Swift; it would be a <strong>dependency hell </strong>to migrate each framework without breaking the many different repos that depend upon on these frameworks.


However, things are a changin’ at Apple. Apple is now more aggressively adopting Swift in their own applications such as the iOS Simulator... and even Xcode!


At last count, Xcode 9 includes over 40 frameworks which contain Swift. You can query this information yourself by typing the following into LLDB:



>   (lldb) script print "\n".join([i.file.basename for i in
lldb.target.modules if i.FindSection("__swift3_typeref")])



This will dump out all the dynamically loaded modules Xcode has loaded into the process that contain or link to Swift code.



# This is using Python along with LLDB’s Python module (confusingly also called "lldb"). You’ll get very accustomed to working with this module in section IV of this book as you learn to build custom, advanced LLDB scripts.
