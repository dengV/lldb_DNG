> Note: Apple frequently uses code names for internal development features. For example, an iPad’s picture-on-picture feature is commonly referred to as “Medusa” in internal methods — and no, not all Apple code names are Greek code names. So, what’s up with this Pegasus name? There’s often specific reasoning to the Apple development team (or manager/s?) assigning these names. Your guess is as good as mine, but I can see a logical connection between a mythological creature that symbolizes wisdom and the visual display to your source code.


> Remember this module name, as you’ll be seeing it quite a bit in a second.
