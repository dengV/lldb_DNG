po extern void _T012SourceEditor0aB4ViewC10insertTextyypFTo(long, char *, id );

```



This will tell LLDB that there exists a method named \_T012SourceEditor0aB4ViewC10insertTextyypFTo that takes three parameters. How in the world did I know this takes three parameters? Check out Section II to gain a better understanding of assembly, and what happens in Objective-C and Swift when a function is called. Now that the method has been declared and LLDB knows about it, execute the following command:

> Note: Apple frequently uses code names for internal development features. For example, an iPad’s picture-on-picture feature is commonly referred to as “Medusa” in internal methods — and no, not all Apple code names are Greek code names. So, what’s up with this Pegasus name? There’s often specific reasoning to the Apple development team (or manager/s?) assigning these names. Your guess is as good as mine, but I can see a logical connection between a mythological creature that symbolizes wisdom and the visual display to your source code.
